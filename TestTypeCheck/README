Create Test cases that cause type errors for the MJ_PA3.jar reference compiler
and place them in this folder.

From the TestTypeCheck folder, run:

  java -jar MJ_PA3.jar filename.java

to get the output for the error, then
implement our CheckTypes.java to match the output.

From the root project folder, run:
  
  make clean
  make

To apply changes you've made to CheckTypes.java (yes, you must do make clean first).
Then, from the TestTypeCheck folder, run:

  java -jar ../MJ.jar filename.java

And compare our output to the reference compiler.

You can check for regressions by running the ./regress.sh script.
